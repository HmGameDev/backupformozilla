Hello!
if you wanna use this chrome extension you either can donate 5 bucks to my apple pay or self load it!

the steps for self loading are:

MAKE A FOLDER NAMED " PIAZZA ENHANCER"

then put these files into the folder.

finally, goto " chrome://extensions/ " 
( you can copy and paste it into your search bar)

finally press " load unpacked" and then select the folder


To use the extenstion click on extensions and then click the logo of this extension to access the configuration menu
